# Design: Migrate from DaisyUI to shadcn/ui

## Context

The project currently uses DaisyUI 5.3.7 as its component library with Tailwind CSS 4.1.14. DaisyUI provides pre-styled components through utility classes, but this approach limits customization and creates tight coupling to the library's design decisions.

shadcn/ui takes a different approach: it provides copy-paste component code built on Radix UI primitives, giving developers full control over styling and behavior. This aligns better with modern React patterns and provides better TypeScript support.

### Current DaisyUI Usage
- **ThemeSwitcher.tsx**: Uses `swap`, `swap-rotate`, `swap-on`, `swap-off` classes
- **CounterPage.tsx**: Uses `card`, `card-body`, `card-title`, `btn`, `btn-square`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `join-item`
- **main.tsx**: Uses `btn`, `btn-sm`, `btn-outline`, `btn-primary`, `card`, `bg-base-100`, `card-body`, `card-title`
- **repeat-button.tsx**: Uses `btn`, `btn-sm`

### Hardcoded Colors (Not Theme-Aware)
- **GlobalSearch.tsx**: Uses hardcoded colors like `bg-white`, `text-gray-900`, `border-gray-300`, `bg-blue-100`, `text-blue-800`
- **CikSearch.tsx**: Uses hardcoded colors like `bg-white`, `text-gray-900`, `border-gray-300`
- **GlobalNav.tsx**: Uses hardcoded colors like `bg-gray-800`, `text-white`
- **EntitiesList.tsx**: Uses hardcoded table colors like `bg-white`, `bg-gray-100`, `text-gray-900`, `border-gray-200`
- **CikDetail.tsx**: Uses hardcoded colors like `bg-white`, `text-gray-900`, `border-gray-200`, `text-orange-600`
- **EntityDetail.tsx**: Uses hardcoded colors like `bg-white`, `bg-gray-50`, `text-gray-900`, `border-gray-200`
- **UserProfile.tsx**: Uses hardcoded colors like `bg-white`, `text-gray-900`, `border-gray-200`

These hardcoded colors don't adapt to dark mode properly and should be replaced with CSS variable-based colors.

### Constraints
- Must maintain Tailwind CSS v4.1.14 (no downgrade)
- Must preserve existing dark/light theme functionality
- Must maintain all current UI functionality
- Zero-sync architecture must remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to application behavior

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Replace DaisyUI with shadcn/ui as the component library
- Maintain visual consistency (or improve it)
- Preserve dark/light theme switching functionality
- Use shadcn/ui's CSS variable-based theming system
- Set up proper TypeScript path aliases for component imports
- Enable easy addition of new shadcn/ui components via CLI

### Non-Goals
- Redesigning the UI/UX (maintain current design language)
- Adding new features or functionality
- Changing the color scheme or branding
- Modifying the Zero-sync data layer
- Updating other dependencies beyond what's required

## Decisions

### 1. Use shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4

**Decision**: Proceed with shadcn/ui using Tailwind CSS v4 support.

**Rationale**: 
- shadcn/ui officially supports Tailwind CSS v4 (as documented at https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4)
- Project is already on Tailwind v4.1.14, no need to downgrade
- Tailwind v4 provides better performance and DX improvements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Downgrade to Tailwind v3: Rejected because it would lose v4 benefits and require additional migration work
- Keep DaisyUI: Rejected because it doesn't provide the flexibility and control needed for future customization

### 2. CSS Variables for Theming

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui's CSS variable-based theming system with `cssVariables: true` in components.json.

**Rationale**:
- Provides runtime theme switching without rebuilding
- Easier to customize colors and design tokens
- Better integration with dark mode
- Aligns with modern CSS practices

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Tailwind utility classes only (`cssVariables: false`): Rejected because it makes theme switching more complex and less flexible

### 3. Component Migration Strategy

**Decision**: Replace components incrementally in this order:
1. Configure shadcn/ui and install base components
2. Migrate ThemeSwitcher (smallest, isolated component)
3. Migrate repeat-button (simple button wrapper)
4. Migrate main.tsx (home page)
5. Migrate CounterPage (most complex, uses multiple component types)
6. Migrate GlobalSearch (replace hardcoded colors with theme-aware components)
7. Migrate CikSearch (replace hardcoded colors with theme-aware components)
8. Update GlobalNav (replace hardcoded colors with CSS variables)

**Rationale**:
- Start with simplest components to validate setup
- Build confidence before tackling complex components
- Allows for testing at each step
- Minimizes risk of breaking changes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Big bang migration: Rejected because it's riskier and harder to debug
- Keep both libraries temporarily: Rejected because it increases bundle size and creates confusion

### 4. Path Alias Configuration

**Decision**: Use `@/` as the path alias pointing to `./src` directory.

**Rationale**:
- Standard convention in shadcn/ui documentation
- Widely adopted in React/Next.js ecosystem
- Makes imports cleaner and more maintainable
- Easier to refactor file locations

**Configuration**:
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
resolve: {
  alias: {
    "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
  },
}

// tsconfig.json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"]
}
```

### 5. Component Selection

**Decision**: Install only the components we need:
- Button (replaces `btn` classes)
- Card (replaces `card` classes)
- Input (for search fields with theme-aware styling)
- Command (for enhanced search dropdowns with keyboard navigation)
- Badge (for category tags with theme-aware colors)
- Custom theme toggle (replaces `swap` component)

**Rationale**:
- Keep bundle size minimal
- Only add components as needed
- shadcn/ui philosophy: copy what you need
- Input, Command, and Badge provide theme-aware alternatives to hardcoded colors

**Future Additions**:
- Can easily add more components via `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>`

### 6. Theme Toggle Implementation

**Decision**: Create a custom theme toggle button using shadcn/ui Button component with Sun/Moon icons from lucide-react.

**Rationale**:
- Simple, clean implementation
- Matches shadcn/ui patterns
- Easy to customize
- No need for complex dropdown menu for just two themes

**Implementation**:
```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" onClick={toggleTheme}>
  {theme === "dark" ? <Moon /> : <Sun />}
</Button>
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- shadcn/ui mode-toggle with dropdown: Rejected as overkill for just light/dark
- Switch component: Rejected because button with icon is more intuitive

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Visual Differences
**Impact**: Users may notice subtle visual changes in buttons, cards, spacing
**Mitigation**: 
- Review each component visually before/after
- Adjust shadcn/ui theme variables to match DaisyUI colors if needed
- Test in both light and dark modes

### Risk: Bundle Size Changes
**Impact**: Bundle size may increase or decrease depending on component usage
**Mitigation**:
- Only install components we actually use
- Monitor bundle size with Vite build output
- shadcn/ui components are tree-shakeable

### Risk: Breaking Theme Switching
**Impact**: Dark/light mode toggle could break during migration
**Mitigation**:
- Test theme switching after each component migration
- Ensure CSS variables are properly defined for both themes
- Verify localStorage persistence works

### Risk: TypeScript Path Alias Issues
**Impact**: Imports may fail if path aliases not configured correctly
**Mitigation**:
- Configure both vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json
- Test imports immediately after configuration
- Use explicit relative paths as fallback if needed

### Trade-off: More Code to Maintain
**Impact**: shadcn/ui components are copied into the project, not imported from node_modules
**Benefit**: Full control over component code, easier customization
**Mitigation**: Keep components in `src/components/ui/` directory, treat as library code

### Trade-off: Learning Curve
**Impact**: Team needs to learn shadcn/ui patterns and Radix UI primitives
**Benefit**: Better long-term flexibility and modern React patterns
**Mitigation**: shadcn/ui has excellent documentation and examples

### Rollback Plan
If critical issues arise:
1. Revert component changes via git
2. Restore DaisyUI in package.json
3. Restore DaisyUI configuration
4. Run `bun install` to restore dependencies
5. Investigate issues before retry

## Open Questions

1. **Color Scheme**: Should we match DaisyUI's exact colors or use shadcn/ui defaults?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with shadcn/ui defaults (zinc base color), adjust if needed

2. **Additional Components**: Are there any other UI components we'll need soon?
   - **Recommendation**: Add components as needed, don't pre-install

3. **Animation Library**: Should we use `tailwindcss-animate` or `tw-animate-css` (Tailwind v4)?
   - **Recommendation**: Use `tw-animate-css` for Tailwind v4 compatibility

4. **Icon Library**: Confirm using lucide-react for icons?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, it's the standard for shadcn/ui and has excellent React support
