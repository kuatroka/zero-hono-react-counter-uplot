# Quick Start After Zero Persistence Fix

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Replica file moved** from `/tmp` to `./.zero-data/` (persistent location)  
✅ **Removed broken table** (`cik_directory`) from schema  
✅ **Stable anonymous user ID** - persists in localStorage  
✅ **IndexedDB persistence** - requests persistent storage permission  
✅ **Performance indexes** - added to speed up large table queries  

## Start Your App

```bash
# Make sure database is running
bun run dev:db-up

# In another terminal, start the app
bun run dev
```

## Test It Works

1. **Open:** http://localhost:3003/
2. **Add messages** using the button
3. **Refresh the page** (F5)
4. **Result:** Messages should appear instantly! ✨

## Check Browser Console

You should see:
```
[Zero] Storage is already persistent
```
or
```
[Zero] Persistent storage granted
```

## Check DevTools → Application → IndexedDB

You should see a Zero database with your data.

## What to Expect

### ✅ First Load
- Syncs from PostgreSQL (a few seconds)
- Shows loading states

### ✅ After Refresh
- **Instant load** from IndexedDB cache
- No loading states
- Data persists!

## If You Still See Issues

1. **Not in incognito mode?** (IndexedDB won't persist in incognito)
2. **Check browser extensions** (privacy extensions might block storage)
3. **Check the logs** for errors

## Your Data

The `superinvestors` and `assets` tables are currently empty. You'll need to load your data using your data pipeline or import script.

Once loaded, the indexes will make queries super fast! 🚀
